This analytic solution eliminates the errors inherent in earlier approximate solutions, and makes the dependence of collector performance on component properties transparent. An example for a realistic solar concentrator illustrates the improvement in prediction accuracy.},

The overall efficiency can be determined by testing the collector under actual operating conditions or by separately measuring these two components. This paper describes how outdoor measurement of the optical efficiency is combined with laboratory measurements of receiver heat loss to obtain an overall efficiency curve. Further, it presents a new way to plot efficiency that is more robust over a range of receiver operating temperatures.},

It is essential that plant designs be optimized for each specific application. The optimum design must consider the capital cost, operations and maintenance cost, annual generation, financial requirements, and time-of-use value of the power generated. Developers require the tools for evaluating tradeoffs between these various project elements. This paper provides an overview of a computer model that is being used by scientists and developers to evaluate the tradeoff between cost, performance, and economic parameters for parabolic trough solar power plant technologies. An example is included that shows how this model has been used for a thermal storage design optimization.},

Calculation was based on a database of over 3400 sets of values gathered during the wide temperature range test campaign performed during 1985\textendash 86 (S\'anchez, 1987). These data were statistically processed and the incident angle modifier function, K(\texttheta ), calculated as a fourth-order function of the incident angle, \texttheta : K(\texttheta ) = 0.991 + 4.455E-3*\texttheta{} - 5.48E-4*\texttheta 2 + 1.426E-5*\texttheta 3 - 1.252E-7*\texttheta 4 (1) Results of Equation (1) are compared with those previously calculated for just one collector (Dudley, 1981). The overall thermal loss coefficient, UL, has been calculated for the whole collector field as a first-order function of the difference between the oil inlet temperature, Ti, and the ambient temperature, Ta: UL = UL1 + UL2 (Ti-Ta) (2) Determination of K(\texttheta ) and UL has improved the control system through more accurate knowledge of the collector field's characteristic parameters.},
