  abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) offers the value proposition of being a baseload and dispatchable renewable energy technology. CSP significantly lags behind solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind power by cumulative capacity and cost for a number of reasons including the complicated nature of the technology and the traditional inability of the technology to be economically viable at smaller scales. The scaling limitation itself has prevented the technology from learning faster due to limited market share, which has inhibited the learning rate and continued to make CSP project financing difficult due to finance quantum risks. CSP has limited but successful lifecycle experience due to the SEGS I\textendash IX plants commissioned between 1985 and 1990 in California. More recently, the technology benefited from competitive tariffs before the adoption of PV and learning rates undermined its growth. PV (as with wind) now offers some of the lowest electricity generating rates of any technology. While this is valuable, the marginal value of intermittent renewables is roughly inversely proportional to their share of the electricity system as their capacity credit diminishes with each addition to capacity, all other things equal. CSP with storage has the ability to flexibly deliver electricity and to do so 24h a day in the right conditions. CSP plants with up to 15h of full-load storage have now been commissioned and are demonstrating initial evidence that they can deliver to expectation. Despite the proposed value of CSP, it is not penetrating the market as expected. The value of electricity has simply not been valued for instance in the U.S. market to date, which has valued renewable targets above capacity needs. Sunny developing countries have been identified as potential growth markets due to capacity constraints and the avoided cost of electricity. Most recently, China has embarked on the greatest capacity growth of CSP in the decision to commission around 5GW of CSP within the next 5years with 1.35GW assigned to be online by the end of 2018. Even with this evolution, CSP will still significantly lag other renewables. This review covers the system value and progress of CSP. An overall description of CSP and its value is followed by a broad review of CSP experience and research. A review of CSP in energy systems analysis is then provided to expose and quantify the marginal value of CSP. It is argued that improved quantification and accuracy in terms of energy systems analysis is an important step for CSP growth. The findings from the review show that CSP has potential to be the backbone of future electricity systems, but it needs to demonstrate value and acceptance to a broader audience than might be expected to achieve this.},

  abstract = {Concentrating solar power (CSP) has received significant attention among researchers, power-producing companies and state policymakers for its bulk electricity generation capability, overcoming the intermittency of solar resources. The parabolic trough collector (PTC) and solar power tower (SPT) are the two dominant CSP systems that are either operational or in the construction stage. The USA and Spain are global leaders in CSP electricity generation, whereas developing countries such as China and India are emerging by aggressive investment. Each year, hundreds of articles have been published on CSP. However, there is a need to observe the overall research development of this field which is missing in the current body of literature. To bridge this gap, this study 1) provides a most up-to-date overview of the CSP technologies implemented across the globe, 2) reviews previously published review articles on this issue to highlight major findings and 3) analyzes future research trends in the CSP research. Text mining approach is utilized to analyze and visualize the scientific landscape of the research. Thermal energy storage, solar collector and policy-level analysis are found as core topics of discussion in the previous studies. With a holistic analysis, it is found that direct steam generation (DSG) is a promising innovation which is reviewed in this study. This paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the CSP technologies and its research which offers practical help to the future researchers who start to research on this topic.},

  abstract = {This report presents the actual incident angle modifer and overall thermal loss coefficient for the ACUREX 3001 distributed collector field installed on the Plataforma Solar de Almer\'ia, Spain. Calculation was based on a database of over 3400 sets of values gathered during the wide temperature range test campaign performed during 1985\textendash 86 (S\'anchez, 1987). These data were statistically processed and the incident angle modifier function, K(\texttheta ), calculated as a fourth-order function of the incident angle, \texttheta : K(\texttheta ) = 0.991 + 4.455E-3*\texttheta{} - 5.48E-4*\texttheta 2 + 1.426E-5*\texttheta 3 - 1.252E-7*\texttheta 4 (1) Results of Equation (1) are compared with those previously calculated for just one collector (Dudley, 1981). The overall thermal loss coefficient, UL, has been calculated for the whole collector field as a first-order function of the difference between the oil inlet temperature, Ti, and the ambient temperature, Ta: UL = UL1 + UL2 (Ti-Ta) (2) Determination of K(\texttheta ) and UL has improved the control system through more accurate knowledge of the collector field's characteristic parameters.},
